#Project: Predictive Modeling with Azure Machine Learning Studio    
Taught by: Snehan Kekre, Machine Learning Instructor, Machine Learning

### Introduction 

In this project, I learned to use Azure Machine Learning Studio to build a predictive model without writing a single line of code. I predict flight delays using weather data provided by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).

### Main Objectives

- Build a predictive model using Azure ML Studio.
- Demonstrate a working knowledge of setting up experiments on Azure ML Studio.
- Operationalise machine learning work flows with Azure's drag-and-drop modules.

### Step Process

- Importing the Data Sets
- Scrubbing Missing Values
- Eliminating Target Leaks
- Conversion to Categorical Features
- Preparing Features to be Joined with Weather Data
- Preprocessing the Weather Dataset
- Joining Both Datasets
- Training and Evaluating the Model

### Result:

Accuracy: *76.9%*

### Accomplished

- Applied Two-class logistic Regression to predict the model
- Able to train and evaluate a predictive model on Azure Machine Learning Studio, all without writing a single line of code! 
- Able to predict flight delays using weather data provided by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).
